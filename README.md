The phenakistoscope is the first widespread animation device. It usually comes in the form of a spinning cardboard disc attached vertically to a handle. When sprung fast enough, the phenakistoscope can create a fluid illusion of motion.

This project takes 11 images from [Phenakistoscopes (1833) â€“ The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/phenakistoscopes-1833/), crop the image, and add the rotation animation. The UI is really straight forward: the user can navigate images and start/pause the animation at any time.
